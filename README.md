Run fun Raffles with your Viewers!
==================================

The Raffelizer is a fun way to hold a Raffle or stage a fight with a single, randomly determined winner on your live stream. Users can enter the Raffle by typing in the Raffle word and are then spawned with their Avatar on the outside of the battlefield. Each of them also gets a random weapon assigned for flavour.

When the streamer presses "start", all spawned Avatars move to the middle and a cartoon-style fight breaks out. One by one, losers are knocked out until only the winner remains!

Quick Video Overview
====================

Have a look at this overview video for a quick explanation of how to use this in your Twitch stream!

Update: Now with Mastodon Support!
==================================

[![A video showing the Mastodon Functionality](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kbBerSFr9OE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbBerSFr9OE)

Added now is support for instant Raffles with a fun animation on Mastodon! Simply select the Mastodon option on the main screen, put in the link to the Toot you made for the Raffle and select the criteria for participation - Everything else will be done on it's own! :)

Note that the Raffelizer will not log into any account to fetch information, so depending on the protection settings of the people that follow you or their instance, it may not be possible to fetch their followers for example!

Picarto usage
=============

​Picarto usage has been drastically simplified now.

To use the Picarto mode, you will need your Picarto username (not channel name) and a bot token, which you can request here:

https://oauth.picarto.tv/chat/bot

Press "Save" after putting both in to save it in the config files and press "Start" to get going!

For testing, this will also work when you are not streaming and just write in the chat!

HTML5 Version
=============
​The game will work fine in the HTML5 Version, however Copy and Paste are functions the Browser will not readily provide for you as it might be a security issue.
To be able to paste a link into the Raffelizer, please copy it into your clipboard and when the Raffelizer is open, select the Browser's Menu bar and then select "Paste". You should now be able to paste that string into the Raffelizer HTML5 version.

Reset and Run automatically
===========================

To run the game indefinitely, open the Settings on the first screen and check the box next to "Auto-Timer". Also input the time for users to join fights (in Minutes) and time between each fight. Press return on both text boxes!

Manual Mode
===========================

A Manual Mode has been added to the Raffelizer, which allows you to set a custom List with custom Icons and Name entries. You can also save your list into a json for later use.



Custom Background
=================

You can put an image of 1024*600 resolution into your %AppData%\Godot\app_userdata\Raffelizer (Windows) or 
~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/Raffelizer (Linux)
directory and name it battlefield.png to load a custom background on App start.

To toggle Transparency Mode, enable "Transparency Mode" in the settings or toggle it on the fly pressing "Ctrl and T" on your keyboard. In OBS, you can make use of this mode by using "Game Capture" together with "Transparency" ticked.
